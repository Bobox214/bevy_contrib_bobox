# bevy_contrib_bobox
A set of small bevy plugins, for quality of life improvments, that I have developped during my journey in gamedev/bevy learning.
Some of the plugins are behind features so as to reduce dependencies for non-users.

This crate will not be published on crates.io as it does not have real coherency.

Features:
- rapier2d

Plugins:
- Outline2dPlugin:\
    Add sprite outlining support for any SpriteComponents.\
    See example/outline_2d for a simple usecase.
